# Character
## Lore
> A prodigy among chronomancers, Seri balanced her duties as a mother of three with her role as a defense attorney specializing in temporal crimes. Her courtroom prowess was legendary, able to argue cases spanning multiple timelines with ease. Yet her growing power was matched by her addiction to Fanta. Her professional attire became stained with orange splatters, her legal briefs marked with soda tabs. Even her most powerful spells would falter as she reached for her next fix. Her final moments were characteristic: surrounded by empty bottles, hands weaving one last temporal pattern while photos of her children looked on from her desk. As her magic faded, time seemed to slow, giving us one final glimpse of the brilliant mage she once was.
> Rest now, Seri. May your eternal hour be filled with endless sunsets and bottomless supplies of your precious elixir. Your children will always remember how you could pause time to attend every school play, every sports game, and every bedtime story.
