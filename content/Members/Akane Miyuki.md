Born in Sui-no-Sato, this young Au Ra was always different. Akane always was fascinated by the tales of the surface world; its uniqueness and knowledge. Though life in the village was peaceful, Akane's curiosity drove her to seek more, and when she turned 16, she learned of Sharlayanâ€™s famed institutions. With blessings from her people, she journeyed to Sharlayan and eventually became a student of Baldesion. Akane's natural affinity for aether, coupled with her determination, made her a promising scholar. As a student, she delved into ancient magic, and eventually met her mentor and precious friend, Krile Baldesion. Not long after, with guidance from her mentor, she picked up pictomancy, and together they began a journey, that is to seek answers to mysteries long forgotten.
